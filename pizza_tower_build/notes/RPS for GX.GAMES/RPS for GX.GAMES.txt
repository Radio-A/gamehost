Retro Palette Swapper (for GX.GAMES) v1.2
Which should detect a Masking Color from a given Sprite, and replace it with Colors from a Palette Texture, or replace it with a Texture, depending on pattern_enabled
	
RPS originally made by Pixelated Pope
GX.GAMES Compatible Version (for Pizza Tower) by burnedpopcorn180
	
This is based off of Pixelated Pope's shd_pal_html_sprite, but this shader has been modified for Pizza Tower, as:
	
- Palette Variables are Compatible with Pizza Tower's RPS System without needing any further Modifications within the Game's Code
- Pattern Support has been added to allow for Pizza Tower's Patterns
	
This Shader should just be a drop-in replacement for the original shd_pal_swapper in Pizza Tower, so yeah
This is also compatible on ANY Platform, including Windows, so...
For the best experience, turn of "Interpolate colours between pixels" option for GX.GAMES
